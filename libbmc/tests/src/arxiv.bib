	abstract={We study the role of the dipolar interaction, correctly accounting for the
Dipolar-Induced Resonance (DIR), in a quasi-one-dimensional system of ultracold
bosons. We first show how the DIR affects the lowest-energy states of two
particles in a harmonic trap. Then, we consider a deep optical lattice loaded
with ultracold dipolar bosons. We describe this many-body system using an
atom-dimer extended Bose-Hubbard model. We analyze the impact of the DIR on the
phase diagram at T=0 by exact diagonalization of a small-sized system. In
particular, the resonance strongly modifies the range of parameters for which a
mass density wave should occur.},
